LINKED LISTS
A linked list is another approach to collecting similar data. However, unlike an array, elements in a linked list are not in consecutive memory locations. A linked list is composed of nodes which are connected with each other using pointers.

TASK 0
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
You are allowed to use printf
