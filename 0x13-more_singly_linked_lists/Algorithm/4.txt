Algorithm for 4
A function that frees a listint_t list.

1.Declare a tem pointer of type struct 
2..Declear a function that take a pointer to the head of the list
2.Start  a while loop that will continue to run as long as the head pointer is not NULL. 
This loop will iterate through the linked list starting at the head node.
3.inside the loop, assigns the next pointer of the current node (pointed to by head) to the temp pointer variable. 
This stores a reference to the next node in the list before we free the current node.
